# GoF

The Goodness of Fit (GoF) metric summarizes multiple statistical parameters and can be used to classify algorithms' performances. It is based on radar plots and calculated by the product of plot area and distance between the centroid and the plot center. GoF was initially designed for turbidity and suspended particulate matter remote sensing algorithms, applied to Patos Lagoon (Brazil), and may be used for other applications.

Further information is available in reference (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16091497): Optimizing Optical Coastal Remote-Sensing Products: Recommendations for Regional Algorithm Calibration (2024).

The repository contains a jupyter notebook (GoF.ipynb) with code in Python to estimate GoF using some example data (example_data.csv).
